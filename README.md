- ``index.html``: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the website.
- ``css/style.css``: This is the CSS file that contains all the styles for the website.
- ``img/``: This directory contains all the images used in the website.

## Features

The website includes the following sections:

- **Header**: Contains the restaurant's logo and a navigation bar with links to various sections of the website.
- **Main**: Contains a welcome message and a Google Maps embed showing the restaurant's location.
- **Footer**: Contains copyright information.

## How to Run

To view the website, simply open the ``index.html`` file in any web browser.

## Future Improvements

While this project serves as a basic introduction to HTML and CSS, there are several improvements that could be made in the future:

- Adding interactivity with JavaScript.
